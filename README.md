CitiBike Tableau Homework

## CitiBike Analysis

#### Twelve datasets were used for this homework assignment. The datasets selected were for Jersey City CitiBike data for Years 2019 and 2020. I wanted to compare 6 months worth of data to do a month over month comparison for User Count, Station and Trip Duration.

#### The data shows a decrease in overall user counts for both Male and Female genders for periods March 2020 to June 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019. See Tableau story for details.

#### The data shows a decrease in Start Station and End Station for the Grove St. PATH station. See Tableau story for details.

#### The data shows an increase in trip duration for the months of 2020 to June 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019. See Tableau story for details.

#### I used Pandas to do the data clean up for the Jersey City CitiBike data.
* Imported all 12 datasets in Pandas
* Merged the 12 datasets and created a combined dataframe
* Changed the data type for 'starttime and stoptime' series
* Added columns for 'year', 'period', and 'minutes' for trip duration
* Changed the Gender column to represent 'Male' and 'Female gender
* The file combined and cleaned data file is citidata.csv

#### The csv file (citidata.csv) is the data source used for Tableau.
