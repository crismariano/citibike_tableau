CitiBike Tableau Homework

##CitiBike Analysis

### Twelve datasets were used for this homework assignment. The datasets selected were for Jersey City CitiBike data for Years 2019 and 2020. I wanted to compare 6 months worth of data to do a month over month comparison for User Count, Station and Trip Duration.

### The data shows a decrease in overall user counts for both Male and Female genders for periods March 2020 to June 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019.
### The data shows a decrease in Start Station and End Station for the Grove St. PATH station.
### The data shows an increase in trip duration for the months of 2020 to June 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019.
